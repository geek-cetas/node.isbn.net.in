This library is a simple interface for isbn.net.in.
For ex : Please have a look at test.js file.
The library is built using nodejs event emitter. So all the function calls are asynchronous.
The library supports only two events as of now.
    * error
    * success
As the name suggests error is raised if any error occurs in the library and success on a successful operation.

Events:
    * error : Triggers the callback with a parameter of type 'error' which has code and desc as its attributes
    * success : Triggers the callback whose parameter is a collection of 'Book' objects. Book has 3 attributes
                * vendor
                * price
                * url

The collection 'Books' support simple operations such as:
    -> count()    : Returns the number of vendors having the book
    -> cheapest() : Returns the cheapest vendor of all
    -> vendors()  : Returns the list of vendors.
    -> Books['<vendor>'] : Can lookup directly on the class via vendor name.
                            Ex : To look up for flipkart we can do
                                 Books['flipkart'] or Books.flipkart which returns a Book object.

This library is released under BSD license and feel free to modify and play with it. In case of
